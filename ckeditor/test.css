* With our version it should be much easier to achieve real WYSIWGY.
* t defines the
* initial font of the editor and background color.
*
*Conventionally a user can configure the editor to use another CSS file via
*  FCKConfig.EditorAreaCSS key in the configuration file.
*  It's easier to use @import as we have below here as you can add any 
*  modifications below the @import command.
*  You may want to change the "body" styles to match your editor web site, for
*  background color and font family and size.
*  
*  Our default font size is 16 as we like to see and read what we
*  our editing.
